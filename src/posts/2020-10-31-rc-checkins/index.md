pageTitle: My coding journal from Recurse Center
---

Because of COVID-19, my time at Recurse Center was remote. The hardest part was staying checked-in and accountable. One thing that helped me was writing up a little check-in every day (okay, almost every day). 

I kept track of two things: what I did "yesterday", and what I'd plan on doing "today". Throughout the day, as I'd finish things, I'd add them to the following day's "yesterday", so that I'd have my "yesterday" post ready to go every morning. Then, I'd post my update to the "checkins" thread in Recurse Center's shared chat.

If you want to know what remote Recurse Center felt like, here's [every check-in I ever made](https://www.notion.so/Recurse-Center-Coding-Journal-eee65414c35743d881727ca4db4442a4).
