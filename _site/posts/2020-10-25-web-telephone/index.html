<hr>
<p>Way back in 2014, I collaborated with my friend <a href="https://github.com/7imon7ays">Simon</a> on a really silly project: building an online game of telephone. We built it and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/247ctc/the_worlds_biggest_game_of_telephone_ever/">posted it on Reddit</a>, and it took off quickly: we received 100,000 in the first week. Granted, maybe 30% of those were swastikas and penis drawings, but still.</p>
<h3>User experience</h3>
<p>When you visited the home page, one of two situations could occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>You'd see a hand-drawn image, and asked to describe what it is in English.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="drawing.png" alt="drawn image"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You'd see a short phrase, and have to draw your best version of that phrase in a little canvas.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="english.png" alt="prompt in english"></p>
<p>Then, in either case, you'd be taken to a page that would show your submission, then your prompt, then the prompt that the prompt responded to, then that prompt's prompt, etc.</p>

<h3>Dealing with concurrent submissions</h3>
<p>What do you do when multiple people respond to the same post? After all, this thing exists on the internet with no auth whatsoever.</p>
<h4>Choose the earliest? No.</h4>
<p>One option would be to just reject all concurrent submissions except the first. Not great if you draw a true masterpiece and then are told &quot;hey sorry we can't use it so it's gone forever.&quot;</p>
<p>The game was called &quot;The World's Biggest Game Of Telephone Ever&quot;, and it was important to us to build the longest chain of answers possible. So we really didn't want to throw out users answers.</p>
<h4>Branching? Yes!</h4>
<p>We decided to implement branching. Let's say a prompt receives 3 concurrent submissions. We would make all 3 submissions &quot;public&quot;, such that they would go live on the site and could all get responses. But how to choose which of the 3 submissions to show to the next person who visits the homepage? Well, it could have been random, but again, we wanted to make as long of a chain as possible. So we would randomly choose from the three submissions with a bias towards the one that was on the longest branch, ie. had the most parent nodes.</p>
<h3>No &quot;users&quot;</h3>
<p>We wanted to keep things really simple and fast, so we didn't do any sort of auth. But we did add some features that I guess you would call &quot;growth hacks&quot; to keep people engaged:</p>

    <figcaption>We made is very easy to pass in your email, so that you'd receive a notification when somebody responded to your post. Pretty good incentive to give out your email.</figcaption>
