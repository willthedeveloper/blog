            <p>Back in 2017, I made a website called Book Buddy that was a &quot;fitness tracker for reading&quot;. A redditor found about out it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books">/r/books</a>, and we did a little interview together, which you can find <a href="https://www.buzzbookstore.com/blog/2017/6/14/a-brief-conversation-with-will-mortiz-creator-of-bookbuddy">here</a>.</p>
<p>I made this at a time where I was particularly gung-ho about forcing myself to read. Since I've never been a bookworm, treating reading like exercise felt like a good idea.</p>
<p>The app is no longer live, but here are some screenshots that show how it worked:</p>

    <figcaption>Your "Today" page would show what books you were reading, and a calendar for how many days you read that month.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>You could maintain your library and add books via the Google Books API.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>You could take notes, and be able to consult them later. I like doing after in order to consolidate my thoughts, and have something that I can quickly go back to if I want to reflect on the book.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I felt like this app combined things that already existed at the time: a &quot;tracking&quot; interface similar to Github commit history or any habit tracking app, a rich text editor, etc. I left it in a place where I felt like it didn't do any of those things particularly well. At the very least, it sure was prettier and nicer to interact with than Goodreads.</p>
<p>Here are Github links to the <a href="https://github.com/willthefirst/book-buddy">front-end</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/willthefirst/book-buddy-api">API</a>.</p>
