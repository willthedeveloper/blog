            <p>Because of COVID-19, my time at Recurse Center was remote. The hardest part was staying checked-in and accountable. One thing that helped me was writing up a little check-in every day (okay, almost every day).</p>
<p>I kept track of two things: what I did &quot;yesterday&quot;, and what I'd plan on doing &quot;today&quot;. Throughout the day, as I'd finish things, I'd add them to the following day's &quot;yesterday&quot;, so that I'd have my &quot;yesterday&quot; post ready to go every morning. Then, I'd post my update to the &quot;checkins&quot; thread in Recurse Center's shared chat.</p>
<p>If you want to know what remote Recurse Center felt like, here's <a href="https://www.notion.so/Recurse-Center-Coding-Journal-eee65414c35743d881727ca4db4442a4">every check-in I ever made</a>.</p>
