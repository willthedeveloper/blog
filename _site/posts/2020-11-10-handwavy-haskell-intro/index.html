            <p>I spent the first 7 weeks of my time stint at <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> learning Haskell. Why would a front end developer spend time learning Haskell? Well:</p>
<p>At first, I wanted to learn Typescript in order to work with types.</p>
<p>Then, someone at Recurse told me that if I <em>really</em> wanted to get good with types, I should try out <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. So I tabled Typescript and started learning Elm.</p>
<p>Then, someone told me that if I really wanted to learn Elm,  I should learn Haskell. Because Elm is like kindergarten for Haskell. So I tabled Elm and started learning Haskell.</p>
<p>And so learning Haskell was a breeze and I got bored quickly.</p>
<p>That is a lie. Learning Haskell looked more like this:</p>

<p>After 7 weeks of being stuck at the bottom of a recursive rabbit hole, I came out the other side having completed Brent Yorgey's <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/">Introduction to Haskell</a> course, and it was a true pleasure. <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You A Haskell</a> was by my best friend and one of the best-written programming books I've ever read. I did my first-ever binary tree traversal, and beefed up my recursive abilities.</p>
<p>After some encouragment from my RC peers, I gave a short introductory presentation that touches upon how monads give us some needed flexibility when working with a strict type system. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Once again, I gave this presentation for Recurse Center. If you want to do a &quot;writing retreat for programmers&quot;, you should <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">apply</a>.</p>
