### Todo
- [ ] Target blank for links in posts

    (then replace old ones)
- [ ] Back to homepage navigation
- [ ] Contact
- [ ] Github embeds (then replace)
- [x] DVD screensaver background
    - [x] Create a homepage directory structure with an "Enter" button that takes us to the real place.
    - [x] All logo images load immediately
- [x] Fix date issue
- [x] Create relative image directory structure for posts
    - [x] Replace current references with  this.
- [x] Proofread everything
- [x] Smaller/prettier h1s
- [x] Make sure eleventy cleans out _site before rebuilding
    - Didn't really do it. Gulp and Eleventy have some concurrency that makes this difficult.
